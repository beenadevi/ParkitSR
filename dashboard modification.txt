I will give you many comments. Let me know what is unclear. This may be different that the spec sheet, and you should follow this list 

1. if the property owner has more than one lot, there should be a dropdown so the owner can choose the lot.
2. The address of the parking lot should be shown across the top of the page. 
3. the box with "110 cars parked" should show the "Total Cars Parked NOW"
4. Box with revenue, should be "monthly" revenue.
5. the box showing "9 Spots leased out" should be changed to "9 of 10 Spots Leased out". The 9 number would come from the total number of spots lease out ( paid for) and the 10 number would be from the spots available in the lot.
6. The box showing "10 spots in lot" should be changed to "# of Visitors in lot - (this would be people that are not registered)"

7. The graph in the middle - Should Be a graph with HOURLY data points showing 1. The total number of cars at point, 2. the total number of Paid people, and 3. The total number of visitors.

8. "Total Cars parked overtime" - should have a date range picker - same thing with revenue.
9. Total cars towed - should be total number of violations

The next section - the footer - should be titled "Activity Stream"

10. First Section (which now shows "top revenues" should be a log of "Cars Entering/Exiting" - Showing a) Date, time, License Plate, Entry or Exit and Status (was this a registered car - show a check in Green, or and x in red if this was a violation)

I dont have any more changes right now. I will think about it and let you know.
